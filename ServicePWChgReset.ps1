# Requires - Quest ActiveRoles Snapin
# COMMENT: Please read comments on each section! 
# 1st - Search Domain computers for matching name and import into array. 
# 2nd - Export matching hosts from array to text file. (comment out after text file created)
# 3rd - Create CSV file of all Matching Critera with full service detail. ( so you have record of modified 
# services)
# 4th - Create text file of all matching services with limited info
# 5th - Change password on matching services
# 6th - Restart services if running if not running skip restart. (with console feedback)
#
# I would like to Thank Halr9000 and glnsize from powershellcomunity.org for there guidance during this
# script creation. I would not have been able to complete this without them and i would have been spending
# alot of time manually updating every service. Granted if they actually wrote this it would be much nicer :).
# But hey everyone has to start somewhere.
