:: Purpose:         DHCP server Watchdog & Failover script. Read notes below
:: Requirements:    1. Domain administrator credentials & "Logon as a batch job" rights
::                  2. Proper firewall configuration to allow connection
::                  3. Proper permissions on the DHCP backup directory
:: Author:          vocatus
:: Version:         1.1b - Changed DATE to CUR_DATE format to be consistent with all other scripts
::                  1.1 - Comments work
::                      - Tuned some parameters (ping count on checking)
::                      - Some logging tweaks
::                      - Renamed FAILOVER_DELAY to FAILOVER_RECHECK_DELAY for clarity
::                  1.0d Some logging tweaks
::                  1.0c Some logging tweaks
::                  1.0 Initial write
:: Notes:           I wrote this script after failing to find a satisfactory method of performing
::                  watchdog/failover between two Windows Server 2008 R2 DHCP servers.
::                 
:: Use:             This script has two modes: "Watchdog" and "Failover." 
::                  - Watchdog checks the status of the remote DHCP service, logs it, and then grabs the remote DHCP db backup file and imports it.
::                  - Failover mode is activated when the script cannot determine the status of the remote DHCP server. The script then activates 
::                    the local DHCP server with the latest backup copy it successfully retrieved from the primary server.
::                  
:: Instructions: 
::                  1. Tune the variables in this script to your desired backup location and frequency
::                  2. On the primary server: set the DHCP backup interval to your desired backup frequency. The value is in minutes; I recommend 5 minutes.
::                     You do this by modifying this registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCPServer\Parameters\BackupInterval
::                  3. On the backup server:  set this script to run as a scheduled task. I recommend every 10 minutes. 
:: Notice: 
::                 !! Make sure to set it only to run if it isn't already running! If there is a failover you could have 
::                    Task Scheduler spawn a new instance of the script every n minutes and end up with hundreds of copies
::                    of this script running.

:::::::::::::::

:: Remote server is the PRIMARY DHCP server we're watching. Use a hostname or IP address.
set REMOTE_SERVER=mikado

:: Location of the DHCP backup on the primary server
:: Best practice is to leave this alone, unless you have a custom backup location.
:: The script builds the backup line like this: \\%REMOTE_SERVER%\c$\%REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH%
set REMOTE_BACKUP_PATH=Windows\system32\dhcp\backup

:: Location of your backup/standby file. I normally copy directly to my backup server's DHCP directory. 
:: The script builds the local backup line like this: c:\windows\system32\dhcp\[backup folders]
set LOCAL_BACKUP_PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32\dhcp

:: When a failover is triggered, how many seconds should we wait in between each attempt to contact the primary server again?
set FAILOVER_RECHECK_DELAY=15

:: Log options. Don't put an extension on the log file name. (Important!) The script sets this later on.
set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\Logs
